Anyway, read this: The message underneath brought a smile to my face.‘Look what I wrote.’ Nikolai is a strange guy. He was a brown-haired boy with medium length hair and brown eyes. He was he was of average build and his voice always was calm. I answered with ‘^^’ and put my Samsung-smartphone away, turned off my light and watched Naruto on Netflix. I was “ill”, okay, I just wasn’t in school. But to be honest, I really didn’t feel good. My (now ex-) girlfriend, Mara, a red-haired girl who is 16 years old, broke up with me and I was really sad about that. My mother brought me ice cream really fast and left me alone.

It hurts because it is so mean that she left me. All that makes me cry."
